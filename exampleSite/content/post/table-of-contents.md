{{< toc >}}

## Introduction

Using Hugo's shortcodes, it's easy to make your own Table of Contents without ever having to think about it, simply type `{{</* toc */>}}` and one will appear manually.

## Customizing

You can also configure the Table of Content on your config.toml, just type the correct parameters and Hugo will take care of it, see more information at: <https://gohugo.io/getting-started/configuration-markup/#table-of-contents>
